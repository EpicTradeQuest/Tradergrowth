                The goal of tradejournal.co is to strike the balance between simplicity, speed
                and actionable, useful learning that should be inherent in a trading journal.
                %p
                By not forcing you to fill in field after field of data and letting you instead decide what's
                important for you and your trading, we can make journaling much less of a chore,
                while also creating an incredible opportunity for you to learn your greatest strengths and
                weaknesses by harnessing your specific trade tags.
                %p
                Nearly every single successful trader in history has espoused the importance of having
                a good trading journal, we at tradejournal wanted to make the best.

                Tagging your trades lets you control exactly what you want to record, while also letting
                you discover key insights into your own performance.
                %p
                Let's use an example.  If you're a technical trader who uses candlesticks and support /
                resistance in your trading, you can track exactly what combination of factors is most profitable.
                By tagging your trades with "trend, resistance, pinbar, engulf " and so on (you can choose exactly
                how you decide to tag your specific trades), you give yourself the ability to search those tags in the
                future to see how those factors are performing.
                %p
                Tag technical factors, fundamental factors, the instrument you're trading, the trend, anything you
                can think of and you'll create an incredible pool of data from which to research.  Want to be a minimalist?
                That's ok too.  Just tag your trades with the instrument you're trading and the setup you're using and you're
                still creating an incredible resource for yourself.

                %p
                No, we let you decide if you want to upload screenshots or not.  More and more traders
                are marking up screenshots with specific factors that impacted their trades and we wanted
                to support them by letting them store that crucial information alongside a log of each trade (with tags
                if they'd like).
                %p
                If you don't decide to upload an image of your trade at the time of your journaling, you can always
                go back and add it at any time.
